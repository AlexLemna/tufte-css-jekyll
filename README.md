# tufte-css-jekyll

## [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) wrapped in a comfy Jekyll theme with `rake` support

*tufte-css-jekyll* aims at closely mimicking the [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)-inspired styles from [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) ([MIT License](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE)) in the framework of a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme for satic pages and blog posts.

It is based heavily on previous work by [Clay Harmon](http://www.clayharmon.com/), who provides [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) ([MIT License](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE)) which also draws heavily on *tufte-css*, albeit with some stylistical deviations. In comparison, *tufte-css-jekyll* tries to stay as true to *tufte-css* as possible.

*tufte-css-jekyll* also makes use of a boilerplate [`rake`](https://github.com/ruby/rake) [file](LINKTOFILE) (provided by [Ellen Gummesson](http://ellengummesson.com/) at [jekyll-rake-boilerplate](https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-rake-boilerplate)), which makes it easy to commandeer the Jekyll site via a number of easy-to-use [commands](FIXME). It alo provides a custom [Rakefile](LINKTOFILE), which makes it easy to push the site to a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).

## Demo page

A demo-page can be found at [sdruskat.github.io/tufte-css-jekyll/](https://sdruskat.github.io/tufte-css-jekyll/). The page ["Tufte CSS"](https://sdruskat.github.io/tufte-css-jekyll/page/) on this site aims at reproducing the [*tufte-css* demo page](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

You theme is setup just like a normal Jelyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
