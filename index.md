There's nothing here for you yet.

If you like the way this site looks, then you'll love full tour over on the [Tufte CSS](./page/) page. This site uses the [*tufte-css-jekyll*](https://github.com/sdruskat/tufte-css-jekyll) theme by Stephen Druskat, and the [*ET Book*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book) font. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with this little bit of the internet yet, but for now I'll just point you towards some other hand-crafted sites:

- [Maggie Appleton's maggieappleton.com](https://maggieappleton.com/), [[source](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2)]. Check out the library. Also, check out the antilibrary.
- [Devine Lu Linvega's xxiivv](http://xxiivv.com/), [[source](https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean)], with a smooth text-centric user interface which I am supremely jealous of.
- [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/), [[source](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge)]. It's everything he knows.

You can find the source code for this site [here](https://github.com/AlexLemna/githubpagesdemo), and the code that generated it [here](https://github.com/AlexLemna/tufte-css-jekyll).

Also, here's a nice blog post about [setting up a digital garden](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
